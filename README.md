Layout Approach: The app uses a flexbox-based layout with a fixed header, flexible main content, and footer that stays at the bottom. The header contains the store title and the cart widget, while the main section displays products in a scrollable grid.

Responsiveness Considerations: The layout adapts to different screen sizes using responsive TailwindCSS classes, ensuring readable text, proper spacing, and a flexible product grid on both mobile devices and large screens. The fixed header remains visible while scrolling for better user experience.
